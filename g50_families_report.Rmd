# 1. Introduction

# 2. Data

Data description and where the data came from. The fact it was a opt-in survey....

# 3. Model

We are interested in explaining whether a woman changed her name when she got married, based on X, Y and Z.

$$Pr(y_i = 1) = \mbox{logit}^{-1}\left(\alpha^{age}_{a[i]} + \alpha^{educ}_{e[i]} + \alpha^{state}_{s[i]} + \alpha^{dec}_{d[i]}\right) $$
where the $\alpha$ are age-group, education, state, and decade effects, respectively. The notation $a[i]$ refers to the age-group $a$ to which individual $i$ belongs. These are modeled as:
$$\alpha^{age}_a \sim N(0, \sigma_{age})\mbox{ for }a = 1, 2, \ldots, A$$
where $A$ is the total number of age-groups. .... Talk about the other ones also....
